      For this second milestone, we were required to submit a working skeleton of our website,
      along with sketches of the visualizations we plan to create using the dataset explored during Milestone 1.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>We are using mostly the same visualizations for each city, so the sketches to be considered are in the London section.</strong>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The visualization sketches were generated using AI image tools. However, the conceptual sketches
      included in our Milestone 2 report (available on our
      <a href="https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/VisualEstate.git" style="color: #1e88e5; text-decoration: none;">GitHub</a>)
      were drawn by hand.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      All visualizations will be interactive. We will implement animations using
      <a href="https://gsap.com/" style="color: #1e88e5; text-decoration: none;">GSAP</a>
      to create engaging transitions and interactions.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The current text on the website serves as a placeholder to illustrate the storytelling direction we aim to take.
      Our main goal is to build an accessible, simple, and intuitive website that delivers clear and direct information
      to users with a specific search in mind — while also guiding others through a meaningful journey supported
      by visual storytelling and data narratives.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Please note that the final design and animations have not yet been implemented — they will be completed during Milestone 3.
