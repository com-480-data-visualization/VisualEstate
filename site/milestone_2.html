<p>For this second milestone, we were required to submit a working skeleton of our website, along with sketches of the visualizations we plan to create using the dataset explored during Milestone 1.</p>
<p>The visualization sketches were generated using AI image tools. However, the conceptual sketches included in our Milestone 2 report (available on our <a  href = "https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/VisualEstate.git" style = 'text-decoration: none'>Github</a>) were drawn by hand.</p>
<p> Each of the visualization are going to be interactive and animations using <a href = "https://gsap.com/" style = 'text-decoration: none'>GSAP</a> will be implemented.</p>
<p>The current text on the website serves as a placeholder to illustrate the storytelling direction we intend to take with our visualizations. Our main goal is to build an accessible, simple, and intuitive website that helps users find clear and direct information related to their search, while also guiding those without a specific goal through a meaningful journey supported by various visualizations and data narratives.</p>
<p>Please note that the design and animations of the site have not yet been implemented â€” these will be completed during Milestone 3.</p>
