        <h1>Berlin: the city of contrasts</h1>
        <p>Berlin is a city of contrasts, where history meets modernity. The real estate market reflects this duality,
          with
          a mix of historic buildings and contemporary developments. The average property prices vary significantly
          across
          different districts, influenced by factors such as location, amenities, and historical significance.</p>
        <p>In the heart of Berlin, you can find stunning apartments in historic buildings, while the outskirts offer
          more
          affordable options. The city's diverse neighborhoods each have their own unique character, making it an
          exciting
          place to explore and invest in real estate.</p>

        <p> Yikes... this scaling is rough! But the linear scale reveals just how scattered the Berlin property market

          <strong>Â· Densest region:</strong> Most properties cluster between <strong>50â€“150 sqm</strong> and

          <br>
          <strong> Â· Luxury outliers:</strong> Homes above <strong>â‚¬2M</strong> tend to be large (150+ sqm) and far less
          frequent, classic signs of exclusivity.

          <strong>Â· Small-but-expensive gems:</strong> Some high-price, low-area listings likely reflect luxury

        <h1>A Timeline of Value</h1>
        <p>From 19th-century charm to modern design, Berlin's housing market reveals how construction year intertwines
          with price. While older buildings often carry premium tags in iconic neighborhoods, more recent builds show
          how accessibility and area matter just as much as age. This scatterplot maps the evolving value of Berlin's

        <h1>Energy Source and Real Estate Value</h1>

      <p>
  Energy sources do more than power a home â€” they influence its value. 
  Properties using <strong>solar</strong>, <strong>geothermal</strong>, or <strong>district heating</strong> 
  typically command higher prices per square meter, reflecting a market preference for 
  <strong>sustainable, energy-efficient infrastructure</strong>.
  These systems are common in newer or renovated buildings, appealing to both eco-conscious buyers and investors.
  In contrast, homes relying on <strong>LPG</strong> or <strong>electricity</strong> often show lower prices, 
  likely due to <strong>higher operating costs</strong> and <strong>weaker energy performance</strong>.
  Energy choice is clearly a key factor in property value.
</p>
        <br>
        <br>



        <h1>Heating Type and Price Impact</h1>

        <p>
  Heating systems are strong indicators of property value in Berlin's real estate market. 
  <strong>Underfloor heating</strong> is linked to the highest prices per square meter, reflecting its use in modern, energy-efficient homes. 
  <strong>Fireplaces</strong>, while rarer, also signal premium value â€” often tied to historic charm or luxury upgrades. 
  Meanwhile, <strong>central</strong> and <strong>floor-level heating</strong> are common in lower to mid-priced homes, valued for their reliability without inflating costs. 
  Heating technology, it seems, marks both comfort and market status.
</p>
      
        <p>
          ðŸ’¡<strong> Insights </strong>
          <br>
          <strong>Looking for a budget-friendly option?</strong> Aim for homes with LPG or electric energy and central
          heating.
          <strong>Want to invest in a premium property?</strong> Follow the heat â€” go for solar or geothermal energy and
          underfloor heating.

        <h1> Heating Matters: What to expect across Berlin neighborhoods</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
          When it comes to choosing a property, heating type and energy source can significantly impact both 
          <strong>comfort</strong> and <strong>long-term costs</strong>. The charts reveal that most Berlin 
          homes rely on <strong>central heating</strong>, ensuring consistent warmth, especially in densely 
          built districts. However, neighborhoods with a higher share of <em>underfloor</em> or <em>floor-level</em> 
          heating may appeal to buyers seeking newer or more energy-efficient buildings. 
          <br><br>
          On the energy front, areas dominated by <strong>district heating</strong> or <strong>gas</strong> generally 
          offer stable and cost-effective options. In contrast, homes still using <em>oil</em> or <em>LPG</em> may 
          require future upgrades, potentially affecting property value. Meanwhile, a growing - but still limited - presence 
          of <strong>geothermal</strong>, <strong>solar</strong>, and <strong>wood pellet</strong> systems in select 
          neighborhoods highlights emerging eco-conscious zones, ideal for sustainability-minded buyers. 
        
        <br>
        <br>

          ðŸ’¡ Insights
          <br>
          
            Buyers seeking <strong>long-term value</strong> and <strong>energy efficiency</strong> should prioritize properties with
            <strong>underfloor heating</strong> and <strong>district or gas-based systems</strong>, while avoiding homes reliant on
            <strong>oil</strong> or <strong>LPG</strong> due to <strong>higher operating costs</strong> and
            <strong>potential future upgrades</strong>.

      stand out with a higher share of large properties. On the other hand, if you're working with a tighter budget but
