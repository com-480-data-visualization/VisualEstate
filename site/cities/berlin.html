        <h1>Berlin: the city of contrasts</h1>
        <p>Berlin is a city of contrasts, where history meets modernity. The real estate market reflects this duality,
          with
          a mix of historic buildings and contemporary developments. The average property prices vary significantly
          across
          different districts, influenced by factors such as location, amenities, and historical significance.</p>
        <p>In the heart of Berlin, you can find stunning apartments in historic buildings, while the outskirts offer
          more
          affordable options. The city's diverse neighborhoods each have their own unique character, making it an
          exciting
          place to explore and invest in real estate.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong style="color: #ff5e5e;">Deep reds in the center and northeast</strong> ‚Äî notably
            <strong>Mitte</strong>, <strong>Charlottenburg</strong>,<strong>Friedrichsgain</strong>, and
            <strong>Pankow</strong> ‚Äî signal the <em>highest average prices</em>, pushing past
            <strong>7,000/m¬≤‚Ç¨</strong>. These are Berlin‚Äôs cultural and commercial hubs, attracting young professionals,
            tourists, and international buyers alike.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong style="color: #ffa500;">To the south and west</strong>, prices begin to mellow. Neighborhoods like
            <strong>Steglitz-Zehlendorf</strong>, <strong>Tempelhof</strong> as well as <strong>Neuk√∂lln</strong> offer
            more space and calm for slightly less per square meter, between <strong>6,500/m¬≤‚Ç¨</strong> and
            <strong>5,500/m¬≤‚Ç¨</strong></li>
          <br>

            <strong>Spandau</strong>, <strong>Lichtenberg</strong> and <strong>Treptow</strong> remain more affordable,
            often dipping below <strong>‚Ç¨5,000/m¬≤</strong>. These areas are increasingly eyed for long-term investment

          <li><strong>Outer districts = opportunity:</strong> Lower prices suggest potential for growth and
            gentrification.</li>
          <li><strong>Strong east-west price asymmetry</strong> continues, rooted in Berlin‚Äôs post-reunification
            evolution.</li>
